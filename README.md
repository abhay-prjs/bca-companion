This entire application exists solely because abhay_prjs really, really didn't want to study for BCA manually(not so true , please dont beeliev this line).

Faced with a mountain of PDFs, syllabus units, and assignments, Abhay did what any peak engineer would do: spent 50 hours building an AI to avoid doing 2 hours of actual homework(valid reaction tbh, abhay a dumbahh lmao).

It is not procrastination(no seriosly it is); it is strategic automation(just use chatgpt dumb). Now, instead of reading the books, we just ask the AI(it can amke mistakes btw, books on the other hand, idk i dont have any). You're welcome.(maybe?)
