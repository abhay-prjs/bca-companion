# BCA Companion AI

## The Origin Story (A Tale of Strategic Automation)

Every piece of software is born from a compelling need. For this application, that need was the sheer, overwhelming dread of manually studying for a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA).

(Okay, maybe the actual reason wasn't just avoiding study, but hear me out...)

Faced with a mountain of PDFs, unwieldy syllabus units, and never-ending assignments, our developer, **abhay_prjs**, chose the path of the peak engineer: He spent 50 hours building an AI to avoid doing what might have been 2 hours of actual manual homework.

## What Does it Do?

This application is designed to be your AI-powered companion, turning that mountain of study material into an accessible, conversational resource.

Instead of meticulously reading through textbooks and syllabus documents, you can now just ask the AI. It processes the information and provides relevant, targeted answers.

## A Note on Accuracy

While this tool is a powerful study aid, remember:

*   The AI is built on the provided study materials and can make mistakes.
*   Always cross-reference critical information, especially for exams. (The books might know better, even if we still don't want to read them.)

## You're Welcome (maybe?)

Enjoy your newly automated study session!
